# AlertUITestCase
## Using XCTest framework , writing UI Automation Testing.

The user interface has two **UIButton** components "Alert 1" and "Alert 2". On tap of it we show a static message based on the button being tapped.
- If its UiButton with title "Alert 1", it will show "Alert 1 Tap".
- If UIbutton with title "Alert 2" is tapped it will show "Alert 2 Tap"

The code Basically shows the code coverage of ViewController.swift for which UI Automation test scripts are written.
